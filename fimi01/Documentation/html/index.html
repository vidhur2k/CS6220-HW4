<h1>An efficient implemenation of APRIORI algorithm </h1>
<p>
This program is a very efficient implementation of APRIORI algorithm proposed by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant. APRIORI is the most basic and well-known algorithm to find frequent itemsets in a transactional database.<p>
<h2>Frequent Itemset Mining problem</h2>
<p>
A <em>transactional database</em> consists of sequence of transaction: <img class=formulaInl alt="$T=\langle t_1,\ldots ,t_n\rangle $" src="form_2.png">. A transaction is a set of items (<img class=formulaInl alt="$t_i\in I$" src="form_3.png">). Transactions are often called <em>baskets</em>, referring to the primary application domain (i.e. market-basket analysis). A set of items is often called <em>itemset</em> by the data mining community. The <em>(absolute) support</em> or the <em>occurrence</em> of <img class=formulaInl alt="$X$" src="form_4.png"> (denoted by <img class=formulaInl alt="$supp(X)$" src="form_5.png">) is the number of transactions that are supersets of <img class=formulaInl alt="$X$" src="form_4.png"> (i.e. that <em>contain</em> <img class=formulaInl alt="$X$" src="form_4.png">). The <em>realtive support</em> is the absolute support divided by the number of transactions (i.e. <em>n</em>). An itemset is <em>frequent</em> if its support is greater or equal than a threshold value.<p>
In the frequent itemset mining problem a transaction database and a relative support threshold (traditionally denoted by <em>min_supp</em>) is given and we have to find all frequent itemsets. <p>
<h2>Association Rule Mining problem</h2>
<p>
This program is also capable of mining association rules. An association rule is like an implication: <img class=formulaInl alt="$X\to Y $" src="form_6.png"> means that if itemset <em>X</em> occurs in a transaction, than itemset <em>Y</em> also occurs with high probability. This probability is given by the <em>confidence</em> of the rule. It is like an approxiamtion of <em>p(Y|X)</em>, it is the number of transactions that contain both <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> divided by the number of transaction that contain <em>X</em>, thus <img class=formulaInl alt="$conf(X\to Y)=\frac{supp(X\cup Y)}{supp(X)}$" src="form_7.png">. The <em>relative support</em> of the association rule <img class=formulaInl alt="$X\to Y $" src="form_6.png"> is the support of itemset <img class=formulaInl alt="$X \cup Y $" src="form_8.png">. The lift of <img class=formulaInl alt="$X\to Y $" src="form_6.png"> tries to capture the independence of the antecedent and the consequent of the rule: <img class=formulaInl alt="$lift(X\to Y)=\frac{supp(X\cup Y)}{supp(X)supp(Y)}$" src="form_9.png"> An association rule is <em>valid</em> if its confidence, support and lift are greater than or equal than corresponding threshold values.<p>
In the association rule mining problem a transaction database and a relative support threshold (traditionally denoted by <em>min_supp</em>), a confidence threshold (traditionally denoted by <em>min_conf</em>), and a lift threshold is given and we have to find all valid association rules.  <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Tue Dec 23 23:59:00 2003 for APRIORI algorithm by
