# How this repo is structured

The repo contains the following files/directories:
1. `fimi01`: This refers to the FIMI03 implementation of the APRIORI algorithm by Ferenc Bodon.
2. `fimi11`: This refers to the FIMI03 implementation of the APRIORI algorithm by Christian Borgelt.
3. `data`: This directory contains the T10I4D100K and Kosarak (Hungarian News Portal Clickstream Data) datasets in a `.dat` file format.
4. `outputs`: This directory contains the outputs to all experiments run at various minimum support thresholds.

# Running Experiments
Our experiments consist of running each of the two FIM implementations on the two benchmark datasets.
